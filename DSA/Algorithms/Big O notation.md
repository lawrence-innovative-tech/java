#### **Purpose :
- Mathematical term of Big O, refers to evaluate worst case.
- Big O notation is analysis, how code can perform and handles memory.
- It's not describe exact time and space, instead of analysing frequency of performance.
	- E.x. If increase inputs, still analyse how it perform.
- Type of Node :
	1. O(1) - constant time.
	2. O(log n) - It perform half of time in linear or process.
	3. O(n) - n item perform linearly.
	4. O(n log n) - It takes light more to linear.
	5. O(n²) - n item perform n * n  amount of linear time.
	6. O(2^n) - Exponential tries every combination possible closet. (Avoid possible (Brute force method)).
	7. O(n!) - Always use only when tiny processing time.
