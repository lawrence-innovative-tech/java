#### **Purpose
- Sliding window techniques used process sequence of data to find subarray, subsequence.
- It process data window based, the window means consecutive numbers or character. It may fixed or variables.
- It process data sequentially . So, some of the problems required to sort.
- Sliding window solves most of the O(n²) problems into O(n) time complexity, and avoids nested loops.

#### **Use case 
- Finds Subarray / Substring to maximum, minimum, frequency(When frequency involves moves to hashing techniques) or counting.
- Finding Target based problems using consecutive.
- Real-world problems - Image processing, Network congestion control, String matching or pattern recognition.
