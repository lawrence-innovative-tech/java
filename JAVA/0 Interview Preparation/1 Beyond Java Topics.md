### **The Ecosystem & Advanced Concepts
These topics are what separate a competent developer from a senior expert who can design, build, and maintain enterprise-grade applications.

### **I. Advanced System Design & Architecture
Microservices Architecture:

Principles (decentralized data, bounded contexts)

Inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, Async Messaging)

Service Discovery & Registration (Eureka, Consul)

API Gateway pattern (Spring Cloud Gateway)

Circuit Breaker pattern (Resilience4j, Hystrix) for fault tolerance

Distributed Systems Concepts:

CAP Theorem and its implications (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)

Consistency Models: Strong vs. Eventual consistency

Distributed Caching: Redis / Memcached (patterns, cache invalidation strategies)

Distributed Transactions: The challenges, Saga pattern, Eventual Consistency

Message Brokers & Event-Driven Architecture:

Apache Kafka (Deep Dive): Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Replication, Producers/Acks, Consumer Groups, Exactly-Once Semantics, Kafka Streams.

Alternatives: RabbitMQ (AMQP protocol, exchanges, queues) vs. Kafka comparison.

API Design:

RESTful principles (HATEOAS, resource nesting)

Authentication/Authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, OpenID Connect)

API versioning strategies

Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### **II. Deep Dive into Persistence & Databases
SQL & Database Engineering:

Advanced SQL: Complex joins, subqueries, correlated subqueries, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Indexing: How B-Tree indexes work, composite indexes, covering indexes, when to and not to index.

Query Performance Optimization: Using EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) plans to diagnose slow queries.

Transaction Isolation Levels: (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) and phenomena (Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads).

JPA & Hibernate (Advanced):

Cache Levels: 1st Level (Session) vs. 2nd Level (SessionFactory) caching.

Advanced Mappings: Inheritance strategies (SINGLE_TABLE, JOINED, TABLE_PER_CLASS), @ElementCollection.

Pagination: Efficient paging using setFirstResult()/setMaxResults().

JDBC Batching: How to configure and use it for bulk operations.

NoSQL Databases:

Types & Use Cases:

Document: MongoDB (for unstructured, hierarchical data)

Key-Value: Redis (for caching, sessions), DynamoDB

Columnar: Cassandra (for high write throughput, time-series data)

Graph: Neo4j (for relationship-heavy data like social networks)

### **III. DevOps, Cloud, & Infrastructure (Production Readiness)
Containerization & Orchestration:

Docker: Multi-stage builds, Docker networking, best practices for creating minimal images.

Kubernetes (K8s): Core concepts - Pods, Deployments, Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Persistent Volumes.

Service Meshes: Istio / Linkerd (for advanced traffic management, security, observability).

Cloud Providers (Pick one to specialize in):

AWS: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, EKS, SQS, Lambda

Azure: App Services, Azure SQL, AKS, Active Directory

GCP: Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, GKE, BigQuery

CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment):

Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile, GitLab CI YAML, GitHub Actions)

Strategies: Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Releases

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, AWS CloudFormation.

### **IV. Software Craftsmanship & Best Practices
Testing:

Test Pyramid: Unit tests (Mockito, JUnit 5) -> Integration tests (@SpringBootTest) -> End-to-End tests.

Testcontainers: For true integration testing with real databases and services in Docker containers.

Property-Based Testing: jqwik for generating test cases.

Code Quality & Maintainability:

Design Patterns: Beyond basics - Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Observer, Strategy, Template Method. Understand when to use them.

Architectural Patterns: Layered Architecture, Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture.

Code Metrics: Static analysis tools (SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle).

Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI. Be able to explain them with examples.

Build Tools & Dependency Management:

Maven vs. Gradle: Deep understanding of the build lifecycle, dependency scopes, and creating multi-module projects.

Monitoring & Observability (Logging, Metrics, Traces):

Centralized Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki.

Metrics: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards.

Distributed Tracing: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin for debugging microservices.

### **V. Complementary Languages & Paradigms
Basics of Front-End: Understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript helps in full-stack contexts and communication with front-end teams.

Scripting Language: Python or Bash for writing automation scripts.

Functional Programming Concepts: Immutability, higher-order functions, pure functions. (Java Streams are inspired by this).
