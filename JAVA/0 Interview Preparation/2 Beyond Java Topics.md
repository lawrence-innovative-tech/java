### **The Ecosystem & Advanced Concepts
These topics are what separate a competent developer from a senior expert who can design, build, and maintain enterprise-grade applications.

### **I. Advanced System Design & Architecture

Microservices Architecture:
1. Principles (decentralized data, bounded contexts)
2. Inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, Async Messaging)
3. Service Discovery & Registration (Eureka, Consul)
4. API Gateway pattern (Spring Cloud Gateway)
5. Circuit Breaker pattern (Resilience4j, Hystrix) for fault tolerance
6. Distributed Systems Concepts:
7. CAP Theorem and its implications (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)
8. Consistency Models: Strong vs. Eventual consistency
9. Distributed Caching: Redis / Memcached (patterns, cache invalidation strategies)
10. Distributed Transactions: The challenges, Saga pattern, Eventual Consistency
11. Message Brokers & Event-Driven Architecture:
12. Apache Kafka (Deep Dive): Brokers, Topics, Partitions, Replication, Producers/Acks, Consumer Groups, Exactly-Once Semantics, Kafka Streams.
13. Alternatives: RabbitMQ (AMQP protocol, exchanges, queues) vs. Kafka comparison.
14. API Design:
15. RESTful principles (HATEOAS, resource nesting)
16. Authentication/Authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, OpenID Connect)
17. API versioning strategies
18. Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
### **II. Deep Dive into Persistence & Databases

SQL & Database Engineering:
1. Advanced SQL: Complex joins, subqueries, correlated subqueries, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
2. Indexing: How B-Tree indexes work, composite indexes, covering indexes, when to and not to index.
3. Query Performance Optimization: Using EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) plans to diagnose slow queries.
4. Transaction Isolation Levels: (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) and phenomena (Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads).
5. JPA & Hibernate (Advanced):
6. Cache Levels: 1st Level (Session) vs. 2nd Level (SessionFactory) caching.
7. Advanced Mappings: Inheritance strategies (SINGLE_TABLE, JOINED, TABLE_PER_CLASS), @ElementCollection.
8. Pagination: Efficient paging using setFirstResult()/setMaxResults().
9. JDBC Batching: How to configure and use it for bulk operations.
10. NoSQL Databases:
11. Types & Use Cases:
12. Document: MongoDB (for unstructured, hierarchical data)
13. Key-Value: Redis (for caching, sessions), DynamoDB
14. Columnar: Cassandra (for high write throughput, time-series data)
15. Graph: Neo4j (for relationship-heavy data like social networks)
### **III. DevOps, Cloud, & Infrastructure (Production Readiness)

Containerization & Orchestration:
1. Docker: Multi-stage builds, Docker networking, best practices for creating minimal images.
2. Kubernetes (K8s): Core concepts - Pods, Deployments, Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Persistent Volumes.
3. Service Meshes: Istio / Linkerd (for advanced traffic management, security, observability).
4. Cloud Providers (Pick one to specialize in):
5. AWS: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, EKS, SQS, Lambda
6. Azure: App Services, Azure SQL, AKS, Active Directory
7. GCP: Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, GKE, BigQuery
8. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment):
9. Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile, GitLab CI YAML, GitHub Actions)
10. Strategies: Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Releases
11. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, AWS CloudFormation.
### **IV. Software Craftsmanship & Best Practices
Testing:

1. Test Pyramid: Unit tests (Mockito, JUnit 5) -> Integration tests (@SpringBootTest) -> End-to-End tests.
2. Testcontainers: For true integration testing with real databases and services in Docker containers.
3. Property-Based Testing: jqwik for generating test cases.
4. Code Quality & Maintainability:
5. Design Patterns: Beyond basics - Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Observer, Strategy, Template Method. Understand when to use them.
6. Architectural Patterns: Layered Architecture, Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture.
7. Code Metrics: Static analysis tools (SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle).
8. Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI. Be able to explain them with examples.
9. Build Tools & Dependency Management:
10. Maven vs. Gradle: Deep understanding of the build lifecycle, dependency scopes, and creating multi-module projects.
11. Monitoring & Observability (Logging, Metrics, Traces):
12. Centralized Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki.
13. Metrics: Micrometer, Prometheus, Grafana dashboards.
14. Distributed Tracing: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin for debugging microservices.
### **V. Complementary Languages & Paradigms

1. Basics of Front-End: Understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript helps in full-stack contexts and communication with front-end teams.
2. Scripting Language: Python or Bash for writing automation scripts.
3. Functional Programming Concepts: Immutability, higher-order functions, pure functions. (Java Streams are inspired by this).
