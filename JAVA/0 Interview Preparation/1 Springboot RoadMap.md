### **I. Frameworks & Application Development (The Practical Toolkit)**

This is how you _apply_ Java to build real-world applications.
- **Spring Framework 5 & Spring Boot:**
    - **Core Concepts:** Dependency Injection (DI) / Inversion of Control (IoC), Beans, ApplicationContext.
    - **Spring Boot:** Auto-configuration, Starter POMs, Spring Boot Actuator (for production-ready features).
    - **Spring MVC:** Building RESTful Web Services (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`), HTTP message conversion (JSON with Jackson).
    - **Spring Data JPA:** Repositories (`CrudRepository`, `JpaRepository`), defining query methods.
    - **Spring Transaction Management:** Declarative transactions with `@Transactional`.
    - **Spring Security:** Authentication and Authorization for web applications and REST APIs (JWT, OAuth2).
    - **Spring Testing:** `@SpringBootTest` for integration testing, `@MockBean`.
        
- **Other Popular Frameworks:**
	
    - **Micronaut / Quarkus:** Newer, lightweight frameworks designed for microservices and serverless environments (fast startup, low memory footprint).  
    - **Jakarta EE:** The evolution of Java EE. Understand what it is and how it relates to Spring.
        

### **II. Build Tools, Dependency Management & CI/CD**

- **Build Tools:**
    - **Maven:** `pom.xml` structure, dependency management, build lifecycle, multi-module projects.
    - **Gradle:** More flexible than Maven, uses a Groovy/Kotlin DSL. Understand the basics and its advantages.
- **Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**
    - **Concepts:** Understand the pipeline: Build -> Test -> Package -> Deploy.
    - **Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions. Be able to set up a basic pipeline that builds and tests a Java project.
### **III. Testing (Beyond Basic JUnit)**

- **Unit Testing:**
    - **JUnit 5:** The modern standard (`@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, parameterized tests).
    - **Mocking:** **Mockito** is essential. Learn to mock dependencies (`@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, `when().thenReturn()`).
        
- **Integration Testing:**
    - **Testcontainers:** **A critical skill for senior developers.** Allows you to spin up real databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or other services (Kafka, Redis) in Docker containers for tests. This is the modern best practice.
    - **@SpringBootTest:** For testing large slices of your application.
        
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):**
    - **Cucumber:** Writing tests in a natural language format (Gherkin).

### **IV. Persistence & Databases (Deep Dive)**

- **SQL & Relational Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):**
    - **Advanced SQL:** Complex joins, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), indexing strategies.
    - **Query Performance:** Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to read query plans and optimize performance.
    - **Transaction Isolation Levels:** Understand read phenomena (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads) and the levels that prevent them.
        
- **JPA / Hibernate (Advanced Concepts):**
    
    - **N+1 Select Problem:** What it is, how to identify it, and how to solve it (e.g., using `JOIN FETCH` or `@EntityGraph`).
    - **Caching:** First-level (session) cache and second-level (SessionFactory) cache.
    - **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking:** Strategies for handling concurrent data access.
### **V. DevOps & Cloud-Native Technologies**

- **Containerization:**
    
    - **Docker:** Writing efficient `Dockerfile`s (using multi-stage builds), `docker-compose` for local development.
        
- **Container Orchestration:**
    
    - **Kubernetes (K8s):** Fundamental concepts are now expected. Understand Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingress.
        
- **Cloud Providers (Pick one):**
    
    - **AWS:** EC2 (VMs), S3 (storage), RDS (managed SQL), IAM (security), EKS (managed Kubernetes).    
    - **Azure / GCP:** Equivalent services. Knowing one cloud makes learning others easier.
        
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Using code to define infrastructure (e.g., **Terraform**).
    

### **VI. Architecture & Design (The Senior Mindset)**

- **Design Patterns (Gang of Four):** Move beyond knowing names to understanding _when_ and _why_ to use them.
    
    - **Creational:** Singleton, Factory, Builder, Dependency Injection.
    - **Structural:** Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Facade.
    - **Behavioral:** Strategy, Observer, Template Method.

- **System Design:**
    
    - **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Object-Oriented Design (OOD) for a single service (e.g., design a parking lot, elevator system).        
    - **High-Level Design (HLD):** Designing scalable systems (e.g., design Twitter, Netflix, a URL shortener). This involves discussing:
        - Load Balancers, Caching (Redis), Message Queues (Kafka), Database choices (SQL vs. NoSQL), CAP theorem.
            
- **Architectural Patterns:**
    
    - **Microservices:** Decomposing an application into small, independent services.
    - **Monolith vs. Microservices:** Trade-offs between them.
    - **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):** Using events to trigger and communicate between services.

### **VII. Other JVM Languages**

- **Kotlin:** The most popular JVM alternative to Java. Fully interoperable. Understand its concise syntax, null safety, and coroutines for concurrency.
- **Scala:** A language that combines OOP and functional programming. Knowing it helps understand advanced FP concepts.
