Java Topics Mastery List (From Primitive to Mastery)
### **I. Foundational Syntax & Concepts

1. Primitive Data Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
2. Variables & Operators: Declaration, scope, arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, ternary operator.
3. Control Flow Statements: if-else, switch (traditional and expression-based), for loops (including enhanced for-each), while, do-while, break, continue.

### **II. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - The Core Pillars

1. Classes & Objects: Constructors, this keyword, member variables vs. local variables.
2. Methods: Method signature, overloading, pass-by-value behaviour.
3. Core OOP Principles:
4. Encapsulation: Access modifiers (private, protected, public, package-private), getters/setters.
5. Inheritance: extends keyword, super keyword, method overriding, the instanceof operator.
6. Polymorphism: Method overriding (Runtime) vs. overloading (Compile-time).
7. Abstraction: Abstract classes and methods.
8. Interfaces: From traditional (all abstract methods) to modern (default, static, and private methods).
9. Packages & import statements.

### **III. Core APIs & Libraries

1. The Object Class: Deep understanding of equals(), hashCode(), toString(), and the finalize() method.
2. String Handling: String immutability, StringBuilder, StringBuffer (mutability and thread-safety).
3. Exception Handling:
4. Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions.
5. try-catch-finally blocks.
6. The try-with-resources statement (critical for resource management).
7. Creating custom exceptions.
8. Generics: Generic classes, methods, and interfaces. Understanding type erasure.
9. Collections Framework (Extremely Important):
10. Core Interfaces: Collection, List, Set, Queue, Map.
11. Key Implementations:
12. List: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
13. Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
14. Queue: PriorityQueue
15. Map: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
16. The Comparable and Comparator interfaces for sorting.
17. Input/Output (I/O): Java NIO.2 (The modern way: Path, Files, Paths). Basic Byte and Character streams.

### **IV. Modern Java (Java 8 and Beyond)

1. Lambda Expressions: Syntax, functional interfaces (@FunctionalInterface).
2. Streams API: Intermediate operations (filter, map, flatMap, sorted, distinct), Terminal operations (collect, reduce, forEach, count, match), Parallel streams.
3. Optional Class: For representing optional values and avoiding NullPointerException.
4. New Date/Time API (java.time package): LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, Period, Duration.
5. var Keyword (Local Variable Type Inference - Java 10): For concise code (use judiciously).
6. Modules (JPMS - Java Platform Module System - Java 9): module-info.java, exports, requires.
7. Records (Java 16): For transparent data carriers. Automatically creates constructors, getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString().
8. Sealed Classes (Java 17): Restrict which classes can be subclasses.
9. Pattern Matching:
10. Pattern Matching for instanceof (Java 16)
11. Pattern Matching for switch (Java 21)

### **V. Advanced Topics & Concurrency (Senior Developer Focus)

1. Concurrency & Multi-threading:
2. Creating Threads: Extending Thread vs. Implementing Runnable. The Callable interface.
3. Thread Lifecycle & Synchronization: The synchronized keyword (methods and blocks), the volatile keyword.
4. The java.util.concurrent Package:
5. Executor Framework: ExecutorService, different thread pools (newFixedThreadPool, newCachedThreadPool).
6. Futures: Future and CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming.
7. Locks: ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock as more flexible alternatives to synchronized.
8. Concurrent Collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, BlockingQueue.
9. Annotations: Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated), creating custom annotations.
10. Reflection: Inspecting classes, methods, fields at runtime. (Know the concept, use sparingly).
11. Enums: Enums with constructors and methods.
### **VI. Mastery & Under-the-Hood (JVM Internals & Performance)

1. Java Memory Model (JMM):
2. Memory Areas: Heap vs. Stack memory.
3. Heap Structure: Young Generation (Eden, S0, S1), Old Generation.
4. Garbage Collection (GC):
5. How GC works (Mark and Sweep).
6. GC Algorithms: Serial, Parallel, CMS (deprecated), G1GC (default), ZGC, Shenandoah.
7. How to Analyze: Enabling and reading GC logs.
8. JVM Internals:
9. ClassLoaders: Hierarchy (Bootstrap, Platform, System) and the delegation model.
10. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Interpretation vs. compilation, concept of "hot spots."
11. Performance Profiling:
12. Tools: VisualVM (free), JProfiler (commercial), async-profiler (advanced).
13. What to profile: CPU usage, memory allocation, thread contention, garbage collection behavior.

To visualize the progression of these topics and how they build upon each other, here is a roadmap: [[Java-roadmap.png]]

This list provides a comprehensive checklist. For interview preparation, prioritize Sections III (Collections), IV (Modern Java), and V (Concurrency). Mastery of Sections V and VI is what will truly set you apart for a senior role.
