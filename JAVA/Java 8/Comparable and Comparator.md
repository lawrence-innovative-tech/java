#### **Notes
- Comparable and Comparator both are used sorting and searching object and object's elements.
- Both are interfaces, and have only one abstract method, more default and static methods.
- Both act as Functional Interface.
#### **Comparable
- When class should always sort natural order, must implement comparable.
- Comparator can override class's or comparable 's sorting logic or technics.
- It's doesn't support multiple sorting technics.
#### **Comparator
- Most probably used to custom sorting logics.
- Passing two arguments as parameter.
- It support multi or chain sorting logics.
