### **What is JAVA

	Java is high level, and Objexct-Oriented programming language Platform developed by SUN MicroSystem in 1995 (Now owned by Orcle).

### **Features of Java
	1. Platform Independent : Build or Write once and Run anywhere(WORA).
	2. Object-Oriented : Everything in java resolves around classes and obejects.
	3. MultiThreading : Java has special feature to handle multithreading.
	4. Automatic GC : Java handles the memory management, Using GC.
	5. Robust Application : Handles unexcepted exception like running out of memory, wrong input.
		1. Bigest Robust: Memeory management.
		2. Strict compile time checking : 
		   Strickly typed - Compiler knowns type of variables and expression in compile time. 
		Strongly typed - Compiler enforces to type constraints which means String type    operation to Integer. 
				ex. 
					String name = "Alice";
					int length = name.length(); // Correct
					int result = name * 5; // COMPILE-TIME ERROR: The operator * is undefined for String, int
	6. Security : Java has multiple security level.

### **Architecture of Java 

#### **JDK, JRE and JVM

**JDK ( Java Development Kit )

JDK is cross platform Software Development tool to building a java application. it's a Kit ( or a Package), it contains all the necessary to build and executable java tools, libraries, compile, debug, and run.

**JDK TOOLS
javac (Java Compiler ) - Convert human readable ( High level language ) to Machine or java executable ( Low level language [[#**Binary Code]]), without javac tool we can't convert executable format.

**java (Launcher) - 


#### **Binary Code 
	Binary code is low machine read & executable code, in 0's and 1's format.
### **JVM Internals & Performance
